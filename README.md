# Introduction
Send4Fren is unique NFT project designed to allow users to send NFT's directly to a recieving wallet in a single-action. The project is developed on the Solana blockchain and is the first ever to make NFT's become a gift-commodity. This website made use of the [candy-machine-mint](https://github.com/exiled-apes/candy-machine-mint) and coded in languages HTML, Typescript React, Javascript and CSS. 

This project was run live in February 2022 and launched a Valentine's Day NFT set that lasted 2 weeks. 

This project currently no longer being continued.
